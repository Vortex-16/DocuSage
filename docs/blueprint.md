# **App Name**: DocuSage

## Core Features:

- Document Indexing: Index team docs from Notion, Google Docs, and Confluence.
- Intelligent Q&A: Answer employee questions about internal processes and updates, using a Large Language Model to synthesize answers from indexed documents.
- Chatbot Interface: Provide a user interface for interacting with the chatbot. Offer suggested questions to help users get started. Provide a "Did you find this answer helpful?" prompt to improve future responses.
